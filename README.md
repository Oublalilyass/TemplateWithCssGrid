# TemplateWithCssGrid
I first set up my layout using grid-template-rows, grid-template-columns, and then finally grid-template-areas. 
Following that up with a simple card with another grid inside the layout, I then take a look at how we can combine all three of those properties into the single grid-template property. 
Honestly, grid template is a bit of magic and it makes me happy.
